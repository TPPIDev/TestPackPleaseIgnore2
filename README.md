_Test Pack Please Ignore 2_ - Minecraft Modpack
===============

A public repository for all changes to the pack.

We have a subreddit at http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPackPleaseIgnore/. Thanks for reading!

Information
===============

Clients: This pack runs best with at least 2.5 GB memory, and 256 MB of PermGen. PermGen is automatically set by both the FTB and Technic launcher. To set the PermGen in a different launcher add the following java parameter: __`-XX:PermSize=256M`__

Servers: The server download comes with recommended Java arguments. The recommended arguments are what we use internally while testing the pack. You may need to allocate more RAM if you have a large number of concurrent players online at once. Never try and allocate too much, the JVM hates that.

When you enter a new world, our book, like the Tinker’s Construct one, will show up in your inventory. ___Read it!___


Reporting Bugs
===============
Submit ___all___ bug reports on this GitHub repository's issue tracker.

To open up an issue: click the issues tab on the right side of the page. Once there, click the “new issue” green button near the top right of the screen in the issues menu, and fill out the subject/title and the body paragraph. 

What does a good issue report look like?
----------------------------------------

### Bugs
1. Steps to reproduce the problem and the outcome should have actually been.
2. Screenshots, if the issue warrants it, and for clarification if it helps.
3. Exact pack version (including beta version). We cannot stress this enough: Only report issues if they can be replicated with the LATEST pack version.

### Loading Troubles/Crashes/Server Disconnects
1. Paste a copy of the client and/or the server's log on some sort of paste website. We recommend http://paste.ubuntu.com/ as they allow larger pastes than most sites and minecraft logs can get quite large.
2. Exact pack version (including beta version). We cannot stress this enough: Only report issues if they can be replicated with the LATEST pack version.

All bug and crash reports not adhering to these issue guidelines will be marked as invalid until fixed. We don't want to waste time by trying to figure out issues with too little or confusing information.

Any questions/comments/concerns can be brought up on our IRC _[here](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=TestPackPleaseIgnore&prompt=1/#btn)_. 

For everything else you need to know, you can find the information on our own subreddit _[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpackpleaseignore)_.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, have fun :)

Contributing
===
We love getting outside contributions, especially to our mod documentation system, however doing so can be a little complex for some.

First a note: If you are going to contribute, please make your contributions to the ___Development___ branch, not Release. Switch this by using the dropdown box on the main repo page.

Also, if you are just planning on making a one-line change, or anything that just alters one file, you can simply find the file and press "edit", and GitHub will do the rest.

To make any larger contributions, it is recommended to have [GitHub for Windows/Mac/Linux](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) installed (use the orange button for the application, or the rest of the article for command line git).

To do so you will need to make what is called a "fork" of this repository. To do this press the "Fork" button on the top right of the page, and GitHub will create your own copy of this repository. Once that has completed, use the GitHub application to "clone" this repository, [GitHub Help](http://help.github.com) can help you if you run in to any problems along the way. Make the changes on your computer and commit them locally first, then you can push your new commits back to your fork of the repository (again, refer to the GitHub help documents if you are confused).

Once your fork has all the changes you want, you need to create a "pull request" on the main repository. To do this, go to the "Pull Requests" tab on the right, and hit the "New pull request" button. At the top of that screen press the link labeled "compare across forks", then choose the second dropdown on the first line to be "Development", the first dropdown on the second line to be _your_ fork, and the final dropdown to be "Development" again. This may require hitting "compare across forks" and "edit" quite a few times to get right. If everything looks correct (meaning you see all your commits on the screen) hit "Create pull request" and we will review it as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your help!
